.SH NAME
xwax \- Digital vinyl on Linux

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwax
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
xwax is vinyl emulation software for Linux. It allows DJs and
turntablists to playback digital audio files (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC,
AAC and more), controlled using a normal pair of turntables via
timecoded vinyls.

.SH OPTIONS

.P
The ordering of options is important; many options apply to to
subsequent music libraries or decks, which can be given multiple times.
See the
.B EXAMPLES
below.

.TP
.B \-l \fIpath\fR
Scan the music library at the given path.

.TP
.B \-t \fIname\fR
Use the named timecode for subsequent decks. See -h for a list of
valid timecodes. You will need the corresponding timecode signal on
vinyl to control playback.

.TP
.B \-i \fIpath\fR
Use the given importer executable for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-s \fIpath\fR
Use the given scanner executable to scan subsequent music libraries.

.TP
.B \-h
Display the help message and default values.

.SH ALSA DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
ALSA support.

.TP
.B \-a \fIdevice\fR
Create a deck which uses the given ALSA device (eg. plughw:0).

.TP
.B \-r \fIhz\fR
Set the sample rate for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-m \fImilliseconds\fR
Set the ALSA buffer time for subsequent decks.

.SH JACK DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
JACK support.

.TP
.B \-j \fIname\fR
Create a deck which connects to JACK and registers under the given
name.

.P
xwax does not set the sample rate for JACK devices; it uses the sample
rate given in the global JACK configuration.

.SH OSS DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
OSS support.

.TP
.B \-d \fIpathname\fR
Create a deck which uses the given OSS device (eg. /dev/dsp).

.TP
.B \-r \fIhz\fR
Set the sample rate for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-b \fIn\fR
Set the number of OSS buffers for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-f \fIn\fR
Set the OSS buffer size (2^n bytes).

.SH EXAMPLES

.P
2-deck setup using one directory of music and OSS devices:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -d /dev/dsp -d /dev/dsp1
.RE

.P
As above, but using ALSA devices:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -d hw:0 -d hw:1
.RE

.P
2-deck setup using a different timecode on each deck:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -t serato_2a -d hw:0 -t mixvibes_v2 -d hw:1
.RE

.P
3-deck setup with the third deck at a higher sample rate:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -r 48000 -a hw:0 -a hw:1 -r 96000 -a hw:2
.RE

.P
Using all three device types simultaneously, one deck on each:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -a hw:0 -d /dev/dsp1 -j jack0
.RE

.P
Scan multiple music libraries:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -l ~/sounds -l ~/mixes -a hw:0
.RE

.P
Scan a second music library using a custom script:
.sp
.RS
xwax -l ~/music -i ./custom-scan -l ~/sounds -a hw:0
.RE
